## Features

- Understands the RPG Maker MV / MZ tileset formats (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B, C, D, E)
- Loads multiple tilesets file into a palette, and separate the palette by groups when dealing with autotiles (automatically detect their formats)
- Creates a grid for you in the format of your desired tile
- Lets you drag-and-drop tiles from the palette to your grid, on matching sizes (so a 2x3 autotile to a 2x3 slot on your grid).
- Lets you drag-and-drop tiles around your grid to re-arrange or remove them.
- Export your work to PNG, or open PNG files to work on them (automatically detect tileset format)
